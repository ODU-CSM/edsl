EDSL: A Biologically Informed and Efficient DNA Sequence Learner
This repository contains the codebase for EDSL, a deep learning framework designed to predict functional genomic events from DNA sequences. The model incorporates biological insights to improve both accuracy and efficiency.

To train the EDSL model, use the following SLURM job script:
<pre> ```sbatch jobs/job_train.sbatch.sh``` </pre>

Learning rate and other training hyperparameters can be modified in:
<pre> ```scripts/script_train.py``` </pre>

For all model parameters, paths to datasets, and other runtime settings, edit:
<pre> ```configs/config_train.yml``` </pre>

Evaluation scripts are provided in files with names ending in _eval.
Run these scripts to assess the model's performance on test data.
